A web-based AQI management system with a user registration form, styled using Tailwind CSS. It uses JavaScript for client-side validation, PHP for form data processing, and a clean responsive layout for displaying AQI information.

This project was developed as a collaborative effort by a group of two members. Each member contributed to different aspects of the system, including frontend design, backend development, API integration, and overall functionality. Teamwork and coordination played a key role in successfully building the AQI Monitoring System.
📦 index.html (AQI Registration Page)
A responsive web page using Tailwind CSS for styling.

Contains:

A header with logo and title “AQI Home Page”

A registration form for users to enter:

Full name
Email
Password & Confirm Password
Date of Birth
Gender (Radio buttons)
Country (Dropdown)
Terms & Conditions agreement checkbox
Two main sections:

Left panel with the form
Right panel with an AQI information message
Styled layout using nested div structures like:

.outer
.inner1
.inner2
.lastinner1
.lastinner2
📦 script (inside HTML)
Client-side form validation using plain JavaScript:

Listens for form submit event.

Prevents submission if:

Required fields are empty
Email format is invalid
Passwords don’t match or are too short
Date of birth is in the future
Gender and country aren’t selected
Terms and conditions aren’t agreed to
Displays error messages dynamically next to form fields.

Simple email format validation using a regular expression.

A terms and conditions popup modal system is referenced (though modal HTML wasn’t visible).

📦 1️⃣ process.php
This PHP script handles form data submitted via POST from the AQI registration page.
It retrieves user inputs like name, email, password, gender, country, and other form details.
The script performs basic input validation (like checking if fields are empty) and sanitizes the data to prevent malicious input.
It stores this submitted form data in variables and could be extended to save it into a database or display it back to the user.
📦 2️⃣ request.php
This PHP file acts as a server-side handler for API or AJAX requests (though details are limited since it mostly handles incoming data).
It likely receives AQI-related queries or form submissions and processes them, though in this version it just echoes a simple test response — probably meant for future expansion.
📦 3️⃣ styles.css
This CSS stylesheet defines the styling rules for your Air Quality Index (AQI) web app interface.
It styles the layout containers like .outer, .inner1, .inner2, and .lastinner1 for organized placement of registration forms and AQI data displays.
It applies consistent color schemes (teals and indigos) for backgrounds and tables.
The .aqi-table style sets up a styled, zebra-striped table layout to display air quality readings with alternating row colors for clarity.
Additional rules set up the form inputs, error messages, body text, and outer card-like container styling.
📌 Overall Purpose
The project appears to be a web-based Air Quality Index (AQI) management system where:

Users can register through a styled form
Data is processed using process.php
Future data requests (likely AQI lookups) would be handled via request.php
The layout and visual presentation are handled by styles.css, giving the application a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
User lands on the AQI registration page
Fills out the form
JavaScript validates the form before submission
If valid — sends data to process.php
styles.css defines the UI layout and appearance
request.php would later handle dynamic data requests (like AQI updates)
